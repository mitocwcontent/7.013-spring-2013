Course Overview
---------------

This page focuses on the course _7.013 Introduction to Biology_ as it was taught by Professor Hazel Sive, Professor Tyler Jacks, and Dr. Diviya Sinha in Spring 2013.

At MIT, all undergraduate students are required to take introductory biology. 7.013 is one of the [five versions of introductory biology](http://student.mit.edu/catalog/m7a.html) that satisfy this requirement. All five versions cover a common core of material (biochemistry, genetics, molecular biology, cell biology, and recombinant DNA technology). Each class has a particular focus; 7.013's special focus topics are genomic approaches to human disorders, neuroscience, development, and repair.

Course Outcomes
---------------

### Course Goals for Students

*   To be curious about biology and understand that biology is fascinating
*   To understand that the life sciences are huge and interface with almost every other discipline
*   To understand that life sciences and biology are studied in a rigorous way
*   To understand that biology is all about problem solving and applying information, not just learning information
*   To be able to make hypotheses and solve problems in biology

### Possibilities for Further Study and Future Careers

Students from this course go into many different majors, but it is estimated that at least half of them end up majoring in an area with a life sciences focus and/or conducting undergraduate research in a life sciences based lab. There are [13 majors based in the life sciences](http://lifesciences.scripts.mit.edu/undergraduate/index.php) at MIT, and almost half of on-campus research is life sciences based.

    ### Recitations
    
    Students were each assigned to a recitation group of 20-25 students. Recitations met twice a week in smaller classrooms like this one.

### Enrollment

Typically around 300-400 students per year; roughly one third of MIT undergraduate students take 7.013 before they graduate.

### Breakdown by Year

Primarily freshman; some sophomores, juniors, seniors, and graduate students.

### Breakdown by Major

All majors, since all MIT undergraduates are required to take one of the five introductory biology courses. The only alternative to taking introductory biology is passing the [biology Advanced Standing Exam](https://biology.mit.edu/undergraduate/advanced_standing_exam), which is typically passed by less than 5 percent of each year's incoming class. The Advanced Placement® biology exam is not accepted for this requirement.

### Typical Student Background

Student background spans an enormous range. Some students have substantial biology background, having taken AP® biology or even having conducted biology research as high school students. Others, especially international students, might not have taken biology since elementary or middle school.

How Student Time Was Spent
--------------------------

During an average week, students were expected to spend 12 hours on the course, roughly divided as follows:

[Lecture]({{< baseurl >}}/pages/video-lectures)
-----------------------------------------------

*   Three lectures per week, each lasting 50 minutes
*   Attended by all students
*   Lectures given by Prof. Hazel Sive or Prof. Tyler Jacks
*   Covered all required content for the course
*   Included use of chalkboard, slides, handouts, demonstrations, and mini quizzes

[Recitation]({{< baseurl >}}/pages/recitations)
-----------------------------------------------

*   Two recitations per week, each lasting 50 minutes
*   20-25 students per recitation
*   Taught by teaching assistants (graduate students or advanced undergraduate students)
*   Included review of lecture material and work on recitation problems

Out of Class
------------

*   Seven [problem sets]({{< baseurl >}}/pages/assignments)
*   [Readings]({{< baseurl >}}/pages/readings)
